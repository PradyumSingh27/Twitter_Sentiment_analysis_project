It's been 3 weeks since I bought a pair of shoes... The girls in my closet are getting lonely 
Oomf... Morning again 
Leaving for nashville. Sooo early  I miss my baby dogs already!
can't bear the world full of tragedies. 
om going to hit the hay see ya tomorrow everone

I didn't have enough time to get breakfast and i totally forgot to grab a yogurt 
That 20 minute nap turned into an hour and fifteen all too fast! Wish I could sleep longer. 
The sun comes out and im full of  cold... owh
