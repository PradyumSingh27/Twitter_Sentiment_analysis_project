Hell no. Rush Hour is a great timeless movie. And such warning will just confuse young people into believing that movies from that time are ""offensive"" and ""problematic"" when it's not true at all.

"My unsolicited movie review for F1:

IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!! My 15yo son and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.  Every minute of the whole 2 1/2 hours was entertaining, engaging, and exciting. There was ZERO woke bullshit - the story line was strictly about racing - no side liberal agendas ruining any of the plot lines. It really was an excellent film - definitely go see it if you can - you’ll love it."
