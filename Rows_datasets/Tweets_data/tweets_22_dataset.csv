"Duration of Androgen Suppression with Postoperative Radiotherapy (DADSPORT) for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Aggregate Data

https://t.co/WWqOHsaC0P

This systematic review and meta-analysis by the DADSPORT Collaboration evaluated the impact of hormone therapy (HT) added to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in nonmetastatic #ProstateCancer across five randomized controlled trials involving 4,411 participants. While HT did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in the general population, it did show meaningful benefits in metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer‚Äìspecific survival (PCSS), each with a 4% absolute improvement at 8 years. 

Notably, OS benefits may be limited to patients with higher pre-RT PSA levels or CAPRA-S scores. 

These findings support the use of adjuvant HT to improve cancer outcomes, particularly in higher-risk patients.

"Duration of Androgen Suppression with Postoperative Radiotherapy (DADSPORT) for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Aggregate Data

https://t.co/WWqOHsaC0P

This systematic review and meta-analysis by the DADSPORT Collaboration evaluated the impact of hormone therapy (HT) added to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in nonmetastatic #ProstateCancer across five randomized controlled trials involving 4,411 participants. While HT did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in the general population, it did show meaningful benefits in metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer‚Äìspecific survival (PCSS), each with a 4% absolute improvement at 8 years. 

Notably, OS benefits may be limited to patients with higher pre-RT PSA levels or CAPRA-S scores. 

These findings support the use of adjuvant HT to improve cancer outcomes, particularly in higher-risk patients.

"Duration of Androgen Suppression with Postoperative Radiotherapy (DADSPORT) for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Aggregate Data

https://t.co/WWqOHsaC0P

This systematic review and meta-analysis by the DADSPORT Collaboration evaluated the impact of hormone therapy (HT) added to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in nonmetastatic #ProstateCancer across five randomized controlled trials involving 4,411 participants. While HT did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in the general population, it did show meaningful benefits in metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer‚Äìspecific survival (PCSS), each with a 4% absolute improvement at 8 years. 

Notably, OS benefits may be limited to patients with higher pre-RT PSA levels or CAPRA-S scores. 

These findings support the use of adjuvant HT to improve cancer outcomes, particularly in higher-risk patients.

"Duration of Androgen Suppression with Postoperative Radiotherapy (DADSPORT) for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Aggregate Data

https://t.co/WWqOHsaC0P

This systematic review and meta-analysis by the DADSPORT Collaboration evaluated the impact of hormone therapy (HT) added to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in nonmetastatic #ProstateCancer across five randomized controlled trials involving 4,411 participants. While HT did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in the general population, it did show meaningful benefits in metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer‚Äìspecific survival (PCSS), each with a 4% absolute improvement at 8 years. 

Notably, OS benefits may be limited to patients with higher pre-RT PSA levels or CAPRA-S scores. 

These findings support the use of adjuvant HT to improve cancer outcomes, particularly in higher-risk patients.

"üëâ Timeless article - The epistemological foundations of data science: a critical analysis 
https://t.co/GmqThcXZwc
‚úçÔ∏è @RosariaTaddeo, Jules Desai, David Watson, Vincent Wang & Luciano Floridi via @SSRN

üî∑This article ""provides a systematic analysis and critical review of significant open problems and debates in the epistemology of data science""
üî∑It ""identifies and characterises some of its pressing or obvious gaps wherein philosophical interest lies""
üí°It ""structures this reconstruction into five areas"", including, ""reflections upon the kind of enquiry that data science is; ‚Äúblack box‚Äù problems; and the nature and standing of a new frontier within the philosophy of science that is raised by data science""
üí°""The resulting picture is a rich, interconnected, and flourishing epistemology, which will doubtlessly continue to expand as both philosophical and technological progress is made""

"Duration of Androgen Suppression with Postoperative Radiotherapy (DADSPORT) for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Aggregate Data

https://t.co/WWqOHsaC0P

This systematic review and meta-analysis by the DADSPORT Collaboration evaluated the impact of hormone therapy (HT) added to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in nonmetastatic #ProstateCancer across five randomized controlled trials involving 4,411 participants. While HT did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in the general population, it did show meaningful benefits in metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer‚Äìspecific survival (PCSS), each with a 4% absolute improvement at 8 years. 

Notably, OS benefits may be limited to patients with higher pre-RT PSA levels or CAPRA-S scores. 

These findings support the use of adjuvant HT to improve cancer outcomes, particularly in higher-risk patients.
