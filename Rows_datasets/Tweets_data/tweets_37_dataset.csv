"BREAKING: Hollywood megastar Charlize Theron enrages MAGA world by launching a scorching attack on Donald Trump’s fascist policies for destroying families and costing innocent lives at a “frightening rate.”

This is what public courage looks like…

“I think we might be the only people who did not get an invite to the Bezos wedding. But that’s OK because they suck and we’re cool,” Theron said at the Block Party for the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP).

CTAOP provides support for youth in Theron’s native country of South Africa. To date, the organization has helped over 4.5 million people and given roughly $15 million to South African organization.

The beloved movie star thanked the guests for “taking the time to be a part of this.”

“Especially when the world feels like it’s burning because it is,” she continued. “Here in Los Angeles, in the US and across the globe, we’re moving backwards fast.”

“Immigration policy has destroyed the lives of families, not criminals; women’s rights are becoming less and less every day. Queer and trans lives are increasingly being erased and gender-based violence is on the rise,” said Theron. “This isn’t just policy, it’s personal.”

The crowd erupted into applause at her remarks, prompting her to add: “Yeah, f*ck them!”

Not done there, the Academy Award winner slammed the deeply destructive cuts that alleged drug addict Elon Musk has rammed through with his DOGE initiatives by criticizing “foreign aid cuts [that] have brought HIV and AIDS programs in my home country of South Africa to an absolute standstill.”

“All of this is not just detrimental, it’s dangerous; people will lose their lives, many have already, unfortunately, and at a frightening rate,” she said. “It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see this kind of unnecessary suffering.”

Her message was not all doom and gloom though…

“But what we also see, what we cannot miss, is the resistance. There is hope,” said Theron. “There is power in all of us standing up, organizing, protesting, voting, and caring for each other, and refusing to accept that this is the new normal.”

“That spirit of resistance, justice and care for each other, that’s the spirit that drives the work at CTAOP,” she went on. “And although our focus is on the youth in Southern Africa, what we’re really talking about here tonight is that all lives should be valued. Everyone should have the right to be healthy and safe and should be able to be seen.”

Theron is absolutely right and her remarks about Jeff Bezos’ horrifyingly wasteful $50 million wedding are deeply connected to her criticisms of the Trump administration. The same oligarchy that celebrated the billionaire’s nuptials in Venice are the same super-rich class that installed the MAGA regime in the first place. We are not only fighting to defeat Trump, we’re fighting to defeat an entire vampiric system that funnels more and more wealth to the rich while the vast majority of people struggle to just get by.

Please retweet and ❤️ to thank Charlize Theron for speaking out!"

"ICE raid West Hollywood car wash on 4th of July—arrest man working there 30 years.

Agents waited until owner went to the restroom & then blocked driveway—4 workers were detained in 10 minutes.

""Why? My dad is not a criminal. He was working at a car wash on 4th of July,"" son of one of the men detained explained.

The family still doesn't know where the ICE agents took the men.

The owner is in ""disbelief"" that agents never talked to him—by the time he stepped outside they were already leaving his private property.

The Santa Palm Car Wash is located at 8787 Santa Monica Boulevard, in West Hollywood, California.

In case you were still wondering if Hollywood was mentally ill. https://t.co/emKrDFOfYA
"We were watching The Myst again. The ending of the movie is so incredibly brutal but there's something I always missed. It's a common trend in Hollywood. The archetypal crazy Christian character. Something will happen and a Christian will speak up and start quoting scripture. They always make sure the character does so in a way that seems outlandish. Everyone scoffs at them, as if its absurd to even believe in the Bible. They always make the people appear insane. Eventually, the character goes completely mad and they have to restrain or kill them. 

This never happens with any other religion. It's just considered perfectly acceptable to smear Christianity. Christianity is the single most persecuted religion and no one bats an eye."
White countries would look like this in less than 10 years if you take jewry out of Hollywood &amp; academia. https://t.co/LkWdGZkyvn
"Why do Hollywood actors and actresses believe we give a shit what they have to say about politics? These same people covered up Epstein, Weinstein, R Kelly, P Diddy and countless other sick people. Anything Hollywood says not even worth used toilet paper."

Hollywood literally never learns https://t.co/eAolAwwmrV
"Once you know about the pervasive ideological biases, propaganda, and subversive tropes in Hollywood— like anti-white stereotypes, forced diversity, or historical revisionism—it shatters the immersion. Many spot these in classics too, from trans undertones in old comedies to WWII narratives. Ruins the magic for some."
Another irrelevant Hollywood retard https://t.co/k3wf32Ki1j
"Some people just want to go to a movie and not get lectured to.

We have had ten years or more of Hollywood alienating 50% of the country.

Carry on with your preaching. Hollywood has another ten years max before it is completely dead."
I’m going to skip seeing Superman now. Director is an absolute moron to say this publicly the week before release. America is desperate for apolitical entertainment and Hollywood is unable to deliver it.

Please go back to making movies like Armageddon and Independence Day. Movies that are pro America and all its ideals. Movies that have a diverse and inclusive cast because that's what the story demanded. Movies where men are men and women are women and there's no Pedro Pascal in sight."

"🚨BREAKING: AOC REFUSES to cooperate with federal auditors investigating her mysterious $22 MILLION net worth.

The self-proclaimed socialist says she has “no reason” to answer questions — hiding behind “privacy” while living like a Hollywood celebrity.

💥 From bartender to multi-millionaire on a congressional salary?
💥 Designer clothes, luxury trips, million-dollar assets…
💥 And ZERO transparency?

One federal official issued a stark warning:

“It would be in her best interest to cooperate.”

What’s she hiding? The walls are closing in—and fast.

The double standards are unreal.
She screams about “the rich” while quietly becoming one of them.

Welcome to the Socialist Elite Club.
They hate capitalism—until they’re cashing in.

"We were watching The Myst again. The ending of the movie is so incredibly brutal but there's something I always missed. It's a common trend in Hollywood. The archetypal crazy Christian character. Something will happen and a Christian will speak up and start quoting scripture. They always make sure the character does so in a way that seems outlandish. Everyone scoffs at them, as if its absurd to even believe in the Bible. They always make the people appear insane. Eventually, the character goes completely mad and they have to restrain or kill them. 

This never happens with any other religion. It's just considered perfectly acceptable to smear Christianity. Christianity is the single most persecuted religion and no one bats an eye."
