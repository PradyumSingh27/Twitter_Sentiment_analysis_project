"$FUN is cooking something BIG! 

Chart breakout + ecosystem heat = potential moon setup.

Here’s what’s happening:

➬ Downtrend broken on 15-min chart  bullish reversal signal active
➬ Strong support at $0.0130 holding like a rock
➬ Liquidity zones cleared → ready for upside sweep
➬ Volume primed for explosion

-> Now add this:
✅ 4.2x in 10 days
✅ AI + GameFi + NFT marketplace
✅ 50+ games, 50K+ active wallets
✅ Hacken “A+” audit recently completed
✅ Trending on Binance, CMC & Twitter

The setup is too clean.
Targeting $0.016+ next  and DCA’ing each dip like a sniper. 🎯

Ride or regret  $FUN might just run wild."
