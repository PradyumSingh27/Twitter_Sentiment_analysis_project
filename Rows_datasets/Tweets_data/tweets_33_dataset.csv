"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.
23.Refusal of new doctors or facility transfer ‚Äî Denied requests to change doctors or transfer hospitals; rapid decline or hastening of death when transfers were attempted.
24.Secondary infections ‚Äî Hospital-acquired infections like Sepsis or MRSA; severe wounds, injuries, necrosis, blood clots and pressure sores developed.
25.Unqualified or transient staff ‚Äî Treatment by foreign, travel, FEMA, or inadequately qualified medical personnel."

"Heartbreaking Storyüíî | Thank you for being the voice to the voiceless on the issue of services being provided by Parirenyatwa hospital. 

I had a friend who I took to Karanda in pain and he was giving up. We arrived when the doctors were leaving but upon arrival the 1st doctor who attended to him ordered all the doctors and respective medical staff to remain in place as there was an emergency and in 1 hour he was attended to and to the theatre for a procedure and discharged in that same hour happy and smiling.

On a later date, the same person had the same condition but this time rushed to Pari early in the morning as it was his appointment day, and it took him more than 8 hours to be attended to while he was languishing in pain sitting on those uncomfortable benches. When he was attended by a junior doctor around 4pm. The doctor teared his bladder in trying to insert a catheter which later led to a 2 day admission. The hospital admission was now due to urine spillage in the abdomen and blood drainage in the urine bag at a very fast rate. We watched him languish in pain and deteriorating in those 2 days. We lost him due to negligence and poor services by the Hospital and a heavy bill was issued.

I have highlighted two hospitals so that you can compare the service rendered by the two hospitals on the same condition. Allow me to thank Karanda Hospital for all they are doing. As for Parirenyatwa, you are failing us and kiIIing us üò¢ üíî üò≠ ~ Anonymous

"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.
23.Refusal of new doctors or facility transfer ‚Äî Denied requests to change doctors or transfer hospitals; rapid decline or hastening of death when transfers were attempted.
24.Secondary infections ‚Äî Hospital-acquired infections like Sepsis or MRSA; severe wounds, injuries, necrosis, blood clots and pressure sores developed.
25.Unqualified or transient staff ‚Äî Treatment by foreign, travel, FEMA, or inadequately qualified medical personnel."
"Heartbreaking Storyüíî | Thank you for being the voice to the voiceless on the issue of services being provided by Parirenyatwa hospital. 

I had a friend who I took to Karanda in pain and he was giving up. We arrived when the doctors were leaving but upon arrival the 1st doctor who attended to him ordered all the doctors and respective medical staff to remain in place as there was an emergency and in 1 hour he was attended to and to the theatre for a procedure and discharged in that same hour happy and smiling.

On a later date, the same person had the same condition but this time rushed to Pari early in the morning as it was his appointment day, and it took him more than 8 hours to be attended to while he was languishing in pain sitting on those uncomfortable benches. When he was attended by a junior doctor around 4pm. The doctor teared his bladder in trying to insert a catheter which later led to a 2 day admission. The hospital admission was now due to urine spillage in the abdomen and blood drainage in the urine bag at a very fast rate. We watched him languish in pain and deteriorating in those 2 days. We lost him due to negligence and poor services by the Hospital and a heavy bill was issued.

I have highlighted two hospitals so that you can compare the service rendered by the two hospitals on the same condition. Allow me to thank Karanda Hospital for all they are doing. As for Parirenyatwa, you are failing us and kiIIing us üò¢ üíî üò≠ ~ Anonymous

"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.
23.Refusal of new doctors or facility transfer ‚Äî Denied requests to change doctors or transfer hospitals; rapid decline or hastening of death when transfers were attempted.
24.Secondary infections ‚Äî Hospital-acquired infections like Sepsis or MRSA; severe wounds, injuries, necrosis, blood clots and pressure sores developed.
25.Unqualified or transient staff ‚Äî Treatment by foreign, travel, FEMA, or inadequately qualified medical personnel."

"Heartbreaking Storyüíî | Thank you for being the voice to the voiceless on the issue of services being provided by Parirenyatwa hospital. 

I had a friend who I took to Karanda in pain and he was giving up. We arrived when the doctors were leaving but upon arrival the 1st doctor who attended to him ordered all the doctors and respective medical staff to remain in place as there was an emergency and in 1 hour he was attended to and to the theatre for a procedure and discharged in that same hour happy and smiling.

On a later date, the same person had the same condition but this time rushed to Pari early in the morning as it was his appointment day, and it took him more than 8 hours to be attended to while he was languishing in pain sitting on those uncomfortable benches. When he was attended by a junior doctor around 4pm. The doctor teared his bladder in trying to insert a catheter which later led to a 2 day admission. The hospital admission was now due to urine spillage in the abdomen and blood drainage in the urine bag at a very fast rate. We watched him languish in pain and deteriorating in those 2 days. We lost him due to negligence and poor services by the Hospital and a heavy bill was issued.

I have highlighted two hospitals so that you can compare the service rendered by the two hospitals on the same condition. Allow me to thank Karanda Hospital for all they are doing. As for Parirenyatwa, you are failing us and kiIIing us üò¢ üíî üò≠ ~ Anonymous

"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.
23.Refusal of new doctors or facility transfer ‚Äî Denied requests to change doctors or transfer hospitals; rapid decline or hastening of death when transfers were attempted.
24.Secondary infections ‚Äî Hospital-acquired infections like Sepsis or MRSA; severe wounds, injuries, necrosis, blood clots and pressure sores developed.
25.Unqualified or transient staff ‚Äî Treatment by foreign, travel, FEMA, or inadequately qualified medical personnel."
"Heartbreaking Storyüíî | Thank you for being the voice to the voiceless on the issue of services being provided by Parirenyatwa hospital. 

I had a friend who I took to Karanda in pain and he was giving up. We arrived when the doctors were leaving but upon arrival the 1st doctor who attended to him ordered all the doctors and respective medical staff to remain in place as there was an emergency and in 1 hour he was attended to and to the theatre for a procedure and discharged in that same hour happy and smiling.

On a later date, the same person had the same condition but this time rushed to Pari early in the morning as it was his appointment day, and it took him more than 8 hours to be attended to while he was languishing in pain sitting on those uncomfortable benches. When he was attended by a junior doctor around 4pm. The doctor teared his bladder in trying to insert a catheter which later led to a 2 day admission. The hospital admission was now due to urine spillage in the abdomen and blood drainage in the urine bag at a very fast rate. We watched him languish in pain and deteriorating in those 2 days. We lost him due to negligence and poor services by the Hospital and a heavy bill was issued.

I have highlighted two hospitals so that you can compare the service rendered by the two hospitals on the same condition. Allow me to thank Karanda Hospital for all they are doing. As for Parirenyatwa, you are failing us and kiIIing us üò¢ üíî üò≠ ~ Anonymous

"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.
23.Refusal of new doctors or facility transfer ‚Äî Denied requests to change doctors or transfer hospitals; rapid decline or hastening of death when transfers were attempted.
24.Secondary infections ‚Äî Hospital-acquired infections like Sepsis or MRSA; severe wounds, injuries, necrosis, blood clots and pressure sores developed.
25.Unqualified or transient staff ‚Äî Treatment by foreign, travel, FEMA, or inadequately qualified medical personnel."

"Hospital Deadly Playbook: 25 Commonalities of Medical Betrayal @Betrayal_Proj @MICHBMP 

Based on thousands of victim testimonies and detailed medical record reviews from across the country, we have uncovered the most common tactics used in the deadly COVID hospital protocols. This was the hospitals‚Äô modus operandi during COVID ‚Äî a systematic, coordinated approach that turned patient care into patient harm.

1.Refused Outpatient Treatment ‚Äî Family doctors, clinics, urgent care physicians refused to see patients or provide early treatment, instructing patients to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù until oxygen levels dropped requiring hospitalization.
2. Isolation tactics ‚Äî Upon being admitted to the hospital victims were denied access to family, friends, advocates, pastors, priests, or clergy. Even in death, last rites and family access were refused.
3. Denial of rights ‚Äî Admission and consent forms were left unsigned or marked by staff as ‚Äúunable to sign.‚Äù Staff falsely claimed ‚Äúverbal‚Äù consent to treatments was provided.
4. No informed consent ‚Äî Victims/POA received no information on risks or side effects of medications, intubation, or procedures as evidenced by no formal documentation in medical records and testimony by family or survivors. 
5. Vaccination Discrimination ‚Äî Victims faced mockery, verbal abuse, and neglect based on vaccination status. Often receiving lower levels of care and different treatment options.
6. Rapid oxygen escalation ‚Äî Oxygen levels increased aggressively (often via BiPAP), causing anxiety and lung damage that led to mechanical ventilation.
7.Forced protocol drugs only ‚Äî Victims were limited to heavily incentivized and harmful hospital protocol drugs: Remdesivir/Veklury, Baricitinib/Olumiant, Tocilizumab/Actemra ‚Äî often forced even when refused.
8. Denied other treatments ‚Äî Requests for vitamins, Ivermectin, Budesonide, Hydroxychloroquine, etc., were refused or ridiculed. Families were falsely told these were ‚Äúnot FDA approved‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù
9. Gaslighting ‚Äî Constantly told they would ‚Äúdie without compliance to protocol‚Äù or ventilation; families and victims told repeatedly they were ‚Äúa very sick woman or man.‚Äù
10.Communication cut-off ‚Äî Call lights, glasses, phones, or devices were removed or placed out of reach. Families were falsely told patients didn‚Äôt want to speak.
11. Refusal to communicate ‚Äî Doctors, nurses, and administrators ignored family and advocate inquiries, often disregarding valid medical and durable POA documents.
12.Sedation and overdose ‚Äî Heavy use of Ativan, Midazolam, Haldol, Lorazepam, Precedex, Morphine, and Fentanyl, impairing breathing and leading to overdoses requiring reversal drugs.
13.Non-emergency ventilation ‚Äî Victims were pressured into early or unnecessary ventilation ‚Äúto let the lungs rest,‚Äù despite no emergency need.
14.Manipulated DNR orders ‚Äî Pressure to sign Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, misrepresentation of Do Not Intubate (DNI) as DNR, or outright falsification and disregard of existing directives.
15.Starvation and dehydration ‚Äî Victims were denied food, water, or any nutrition and given diuretics or laxatives instead.
16.Physical and chemical restraints ‚Äî Used without legal justification or proper documentation.
17.Bathroom denial ‚Äî Forced catheterization or use of rectal tubes without need or consent.
18.Neglect of basic care ‚Äî Hygiene, oral care, bathing, grooming, and dirty linens are often ignored.
19.Dehumanization ‚Äî Victims described as being treated like animals, stripped of dignity.
20.Intuition of wrongdoing ‚Äî Families and victims overwhelmingly felt ‚Äúsomething was terribly wrong.‚Äù
21. End of Life Care pushed ‚Äî Pressured into palliative care, comfort care or hospice early on; often covertly ordered.
22. Security enforcement ‚Äî Police or security used to enforce isolation and institutional policies; families threatened with arrest when advocating for their loved one.

"Heartbreaking Storyüíî | Thank you for being the voice to the voiceless on the issue of services being provided by Parirenyatwa hospital. 

I had a friend who I took to Karanda in pain and he was giving up. We arrived when the doctors were leaving but upon arrival the 1st doctor who attended to him ordered all the doctors and respective medical staff to remain in place as there was an emergency and in 1 hour he was attended to and to the theatre for a procedure and discharged in that same hour happy and smiling.

On a later date, the same person had the same condition but this time rushed to Pari early in the morning as it was his appointment day, and it took him more than 8 hours to be attended to while he was languishing in pain sitting on those uncomfortable benches. When he was attended by a junior doctor around 4pm. The doctor teared his bladder in trying to insert a catheter which later led to a 2 day admission. The hospital admission was now due to urine spillage in the abdomen and blood drainage in the urine bag at a very fast rate. We watched him languish in pain and deteriorating in those 2 days. We lost him due to negligence and poor services by the Hospital and a heavy bill was issued.

I have highlighted two hospitals so that you can compare the service rendered by the two hospitals on the same condition. Allow me to thank Karanda Hospital for all they are doing. As for Parirenyatwa, you are failing us and kiIIing us üò¢ üíî üò≠ ~ Anonymous
