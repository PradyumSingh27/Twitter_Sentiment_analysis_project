"The real heroes never die
Remembering Captain Vikram Batra, PVC (9 September 1974 – 7 July 1999) of the Indian Army on his Balidan Diwas

Posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest and most prestigious award for valour, for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

 He led one of the toughest operations in mountain warfare in Indian history. He was often referred to as ‘'Sher Shah'’ (""Lion King"") in the intercepted messages of the Pakistan Army.

My best moment of life is College Colours for the best student, which I received from the parents of Captain Vikram Batra during my final year of graduation at Dharmshala College. It seems like yesterday whenever I look at that pic.

"Honouring a selfless service beyond the call of Duty 

#GeneralUpendraDwivedi, #COAS, today commended Major Bachwala Rohit for demonstrating exceptional professional acumen and selfless commitment beyond the call of duty.

On 05 Jul 2025, while proceeding on leave from Military Hospital Jhansi to his hometown Hyderabad, he was involved in a critical medical intervention that exemplified the highest standards of military service. At Jhansi Railway Station, he noticed a woman in visible distress near the lift area. She had fallen from a wheelchair and was in advanced labour.

Displaying exemplary presence of mind and clinical skill, Major Rohit conducted an emergency delivery on the railway platform itself, using improvised resources including a towel, a knife and hair clips. The newborn was unresponsive at birth; however, he successfully resuscitated the infant. The mother later developed complications related to the placental delivery, which he managed effectively using available protective measures and clinical judgment.

Both the mother and the newborn were stabilized under his care and subsequently transferred to a government medical facility for further management.

Major Rohit’s swift and decisive action, under non-clinical and resource-constrained circumstances, is a testament to his medical proficiency, composure under pressure, and unwavering commitment to the ethos of the Armed Forces.

"Indian Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi today commended Major Bachwala Rohit for demonstrating exceptional professional acumen and selfless commitment beyond the call of duty.

On 5 July 2025, while proceeding on leave from Military Hospital Jhansi to his hometown of Hyderabad, he was involved in a critical medical intervention that exemplified the highest standards of military service. At Jhansi Railway Station, he noticed a woman in visible distress near the lift area. She had fallen from a wheelchair and was in advanced labour. Major Rohit’s swift and decisive action, under non-clinical and resource-constrained circumstances, is a testament to his medical proficiency, composure under pressure, and unwavering commitment to the ethos of the Armed Forces: Indian Army.

"Honouring a selfless service beyond the call of Duty 

#GeneralUpendraDwivedi, #COAS, today commended Major Bachwala Rohit for demonstrating exceptional professional acumen and selfless commitment beyond the call of duty.

On 05 Jul 2025, while proceeding on leave from Military Hospital Jhansi to his hometown Hyderabad, he was involved in a critical medical intervention that exemplified the highest standards of military service. At Jhansi Railway Station, he noticed a woman in visible distress near the lift area. She had fallen from a wheelchair and was in advanced labour.

Displaying exemplary presence of mind and clinical skill, Major Rohit conducted an emergency delivery on the railway platform itself, using improvised resources including a towel, a knife and hair clips. The newborn was unresponsive at birth; however, he successfully resuscitated the infant. The mother later developed complications related to the placental delivery, which he managed effectively using available protective measures and clinical judgment.

Both the mother and the newborn were stabilized under his care and subsequently transferred to a government medical facility for further management.

Major Rohit’s swift and decisive action, under non-clinical and resource-constrained circumstances, is a testament to his medical proficiency, composure under pressure, and unwavering commitment to the ethos of the Armed Forces.

"Honouring a selfless service beyond the call of Duty 

#GeneralUpendraDwivedi, #COAS, today commended Major Bachwala Rohit for demonstrating exceptional professional acumen and selfless commitment beyond the call of duty.

On 05 Jul 2025, while proceeding on leave from Military Hospital Jhansi to his hometown Hyderabad, he was involved in a critical medical intervention that exemplified the highest standards of military service. At Jhansi Railway Station, he noticed a woman in visible distress near the lift area. She had fallen from a wheelchair and was in advanced labour.

Displaying exemplary presence of mind and clinical skill, Major Rohit conducted an emergency delivery on the railway platform itself, using improvised resources including a towel, a knife and hair clips. The newborn was unresponsive at birth; however, he successfully resuscitated the infant. The mother later developed complications related to the placental delivery, which he managed effectively using available protective measures and clinical judgment.

Both the mother and the newborn were stabilized under his care and subsequently transferred to a government medical facility for further management.

Major Rohit’s swift and decisive action, under non-clinical and resource-constrained circumstances, is a testament to his medical proficiency, composure under pressure, and unwavering commitment to the ethos of the Armed Forces.

"Honouring a selfless service beyond the call of Duty 

#GeneralUpendraDwivedi, #COAS, today commended Major Bachwala Rohit for demonstrating exceptional professional acumen and selfless commitment beyond the call of duty.

On 05 Jul 2025, while proceeding on leave from Military Hospital Jhansi to his hometown Hyderabad, he was involved in a critical medical intervention that exemplified the highest standards of military service. At Jhansi Railway Station, he noticed a woman in visible distress near the lift area. She had fallen from a wheelchair and was in advanced labour.

Displaying exemplary presence of mind and clinical skill, Major Rohit conducted an emergency delivery on the railway platform itself, using improvised resources including a towel, a knife and hair clips. The newborn was unresponsive at birth; however, he successfully resuscitated the infant. The mother later developed complications related to the placental delivery, which he managed effectively using available protective measures and clinical judgment.

Both the mother and the newborn were stabilized under his care and subsequently transferred to a government medical facility for further management.

Major Rohit’s swift and decisive action, under non-clinical and resource-constrained circumstances, is a testament to his medical proficiency, composure under pressure, and unwavering commitment to the ethos of the Armed Forces.
