Barstool Pizza Review - Vezzo Thin Crust (Validation Review) https://t.co/tlZmQ8KRI4
"Tried Ceres in NYC  because of @stoolpresidente pizza üçï review.  

First, they are only selling pizzas by the whole pie. Cheese pizza is $40 - it‚Äôs 8 slices that are pretty large, you‚Äôd probably pay more than $5 for a slice if that was an option (which it isn‚Äôt) so pricing is what it is. Next, we had to wait an hour for the pizza - compared to others on Yelp this wasn‚Äôt that bad. But be prepared that it‚Äôs not a place where you go order the pizza and walk out with it right away. You place the order and they‚Äôll tell you a time it will be ready (in our case an hour after we ordered it).

Now, if you love crispy pizza crust this is the pizza for you. The crust is sooo thin and crispy - there really is NO flop. Definitely worth a try if you have the time and you love crispy pizza. Enjoy! LMK what you think if you‚Äôve tried it. 

Oh PS get the Lemon or Orange drink. They are both excellent."

"Tried Ceres in NYC  because of @stoolpresidente pizza üçï review.  

First, they are only selling pizzas by the whole pie. Cheese pizza is $40 - it‚Äôs 8 slices that are pretty large, you‚Äôd probably pay more than $5 for a slice if that was an option (which it isn‚Äôt) so pricing is what it is. Next, we had to wait an hour for the pizza - compared to others on Yelp this wasn‚Äôt that bad. But be prepared that it‚Äôs not a place where you go order the pizza and walk out with it right away. You place the order and they‚Äôll tell you a time it will be ready (in our case an hour after we ordered it).

Now, if you love crispy pizza crust this is the pizza for you. The crust is sooo thin and crispy - there really is NO flop. Definitely worth a try if you have the time and you love crispy pizza. Enjoy! LMK what you think if you‚Äôve tried it. 

Oh PS get the Lemon or Orange drink. They are both excellent."

"Tried Ceres in NYC  because of @stoolpresidente pizza üçï review.  

First, they are only selling pizzas by the whole pie. Cheese pizza is $40 - it‚Äôs 8 slices that are pretty large, you‚Äôd probably pay more than $5 for a slice if that was an option (which it isn‚Äôt) so pricing is what it is. Next, we had to wait an hour for the pizza - compared to others on Yelp this wasn‚Äôt that bad. But be prepared that it‚Äôs not a place where you go order the pizza and walk out with it right away. You place the order and they‚Äôll tell you a time it will be ready (in our case an hour after we ordered it).

Now, if you love crispy pizza crust this is the pizza for you. The crust is sooo thin and crispy - there really is NO flop. Definitely worth a try if you have the time and you love crispy pizza. Enjoy! LMK what you think if you‚Äôve tried it. 

Oh PS get the Lemon or Orange drink. They are both excellent."
