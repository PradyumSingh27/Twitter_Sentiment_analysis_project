"Jamie Oliver represented the Blairite ideal, and that's why he was everywhere in the early 2000s.

A bland cockney cheeky chappy, who spent his time nipping around acquiring exotic foods from the increasingly diverse and vibrant London, all for his fancy dinner in his Chelsea flat with his New Labour voting managerial mates. 

 Out with bangers and mash, in with the couscous and douro wine. 

The future was Globalism, and all those racists in Norhern towns would just have to suck it and be dragged toward the sunny uplands.

Thanks, Jamie, thanks a bundle."

"I just bought this food and here’s my review, the soup wasn’t red enough for me( ion know if that makes sense) but it had a lot of living things and assorted in it. The grilled chicken was okay ( would have been nicer if it was peppered), the semo was okay.
overall I’d give the meal a 5/10."
