"Unpopular opinion: EU data protection law is alive and thriving.

""In its review of the economic impact of GDPR, five years after its entry into force, the CNIL noted that economic studies on the regulation tend to focus mainly on its costs and only marginally address its benefits. The CNIL undertook to study some of these benefits and provide a quantified analysis. This analysis approaches the topic from a cybersecurity perspective (Articles 32, 33, and 34 GDPR) to highlight the regulation’s positive impacts.""

"Nestlé Zimbabwe Boosts CEREVITA Production by 35% to Meet Surging Demand.

Nestlé Zimbabwe has scaled up production of its flagship cereal, CEREVITA, by more than 35% following a US$7 million investment in local manufacturing infrastructure. The move is part of a broader strategy to enhance product availability, support Zimbabwe’s Vision 2030, and position the country as a regional cereal production hub.

Key highlights:
🔹CEREVITA now comes in 5 variants and 2 pack sizes (500g & 750g).
🔹Powered by Roller Drier 4, the increased capacity boosts local supply and regional exports to Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique.
🔹Nestlé partners with 350 local suppliers, 18 farmers, and employs 149 full-time staff plus 268 casual workers.
🔹CEREVITA is fortified with GRAINSMART, supporting daily energy release and nutritional needs.
🔹Nestlé’s sustainable manufacturing approach includes energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste reduction.
🔹The expansion aligns with Nestlé’s commitment to nourishing Zimbabwean families for over 60 years and contributing to long-term food security and economic empowerment."

"BREAKING NEWS! 

SHOWDOWN WITH REBEL MPS

Up to 100 Labour MPs - including senior committee chairs - are backing an amendment to block the welfare reform bill.

The amendment asks for a pause, proper consultation with disabled people, and a full economic impact review before any further cuts are made - led by Treasury select committee chair Meg Hillier.

A senior MP said: ""The government ignored private concerns - now it faces a public backlash.""

The move ramps up pressure on Keir Starmer ahead of next week's vote, as frontbenchers weigh resignations and backbenchers revolt. Whip Vicky
Foxcroft has already quit.

The government's proposed changes could deny support to people unable to cook or wash due to disabilities - while ministers insist it's about
""saving the welfare state"" and targeting help to those in most need.

My understanding is if it passes, the welfare cuts bill in its current form won't get another reading.

"Nestlé Zimbabwe Boosts CEREVITA Production by 35% to Meet Surging Demand.

Nestlé Zimbabwe has scaled up production of its flagship cereal, CEREVITA, by more than 35% following a US$7 million investment in local manufacturing infrastructure. The move is part of a broader strategy to enhance product availability, support Zimbabwe’s Vision 2030, and position the country as a regional cereal production hub.

Key highlights:
🔹CEREVITA now comes in 5 variants and 2 pack sizes (500g & 750g).
🔹Powered by Roller Drier 4, the increased capacity boosts local supply and regional exports to Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique.
🔹Nestlé partners with 350 local suppliers, 18 farmers, and employs 149 full-time staff plus 268 casual workers.
🔹CEREVITA is fortified with GRAINSMART, supporting daily energy release and nutritional needs.
🔹Nestlé’s sustainable manufacturing approach includes energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste reduction.
🔹The expansion aligns with Nestlé’s commitment to nourishing Zimbabwean families for over 60 years and contributing to long-term food security and economic empowerment."

"Tobacco Sales Break Records!

As of June 30, 2025, Zimbabwean farmers have sold an impressive 323 million kilograms of tobacco, smashing last year’s figure of 219 million kilograms for the same period. 

With over US$1 billion already earned this season, this milestone highlights the resilience and productivity of our agricultural sector."
"Zimbabwe’s Gold Exports Surge Past US$748 Million in First 5 Months of 2025

Zimbabwe’s gold sector is booming, with exports surpassing US$748M between Jan–May 2025 — up from US$599M in the same period last year.

The growth is powered by:
• Record global prices above US$3,000/oz
• Strong performance by artisanal & small-scale miners (ASM), who now contribute nearly 70% of output

The Zimbabwe Miners Federation forecasts up to 52 tonnes of gold this year, well above the govt’s 40-tonne target.

Despite a slight monthly dip in May, year-on-year output remains up 27.6%, with ASM deliveries alone growing 52% YoY.

ZMF is calling for:
• Input support schemes for small miners (like in agriculture)
• Over US$1B investment to hit long-term goals of 100 tonnes/year
• Protection of community rights & tighter regulation on foreign claims

With strong policy, formalisation, and infrastructure support, Zimbabwe is on track to build a world-class gold economy."

✅ Rules with an economic impact > $1 Million get additional scrutiny.

✅ All members are notified when these economically harmful rules are under review.

✅ Rules can be brought for approval from the General Assembly before they are permitted to take effect.

This is a MAJOR win for red tape reduction as REINS reform sweeps the nation!

"BREAKING NEWS! 

SHOWDOWN WITH REBEL MPS

Up to 100 Labour MPs - including senior committee chairs - are backing an amendment to block the welfare reform bill.

The amendment asks for a pause, proper consultation with disabled people, and a full economic impact review before any further cuts are made - led by Treasury select committee chair Meg Hillier.

A senior MP said: ""The government ignored private concerns - now it faces a public backlash.""

The move ramps up pressure on Keir Starmer ahead of next week's vote, as frontbenchers weigh resignations and backbenchers revolt. Whip Vicky
Foxcroft has already quit.

The government's proposed changes could deny support to people unable to cook or wash due to disabilities - while ministers insist it's about
""saving the welfare state"" and targeting help to those in most need.

My understanding is if it passes, the welfare cuts bill in its current form won't get another reading.

"BREAKING NEWS! 

SHOWDOWN WITH REBEL MPS

Up to 100 Labour MPs - including senior committee chairs - are backing an amendment to block the welfare reform bill.

The amendment asks for a pause, proper consultation with disabled people, and a full economic impact review before any further cuts are made - led by Treasury select committee chair Meg Hillier.

A senior MP said: ""The government ignored private concerns - now it faces a public backlash.""

The move ramps up pressure on Keir Starmer ahead of next week's vote, as frontbenchers weigh resignations and backbenchers revolt. Whip Vicky
Foxcroft has already quit.

The government's proposed changes could deny support to people unable to cook or wash due to disabilities - while ministers insist it's about
""saving the welfare state"" and targeting help to those in most need.

My understanding is if it passes, the welfare cuts bill in its current form won't get another reading.

"Unpopular opinion: EU data protection law is alive and thriving.

""In its review of the economic impact of GDPR, five years after its entry into force, the CNIL noted that economic studies on the regulation tend to focus mainly on its costs and only marginally address its benefits. The CNIL undertook to study some of these benefits and provide a quantified analysis. This analysis approaches the topic from a cybersecurity perspective (Articles 32, 33, and 34 GDPR) to highlight the regulation’s positive impacts.""
