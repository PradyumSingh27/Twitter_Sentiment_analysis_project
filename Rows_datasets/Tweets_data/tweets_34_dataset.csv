"Another taxpayer-funded sporting event for drunken Albanese and his unemployed girlfriend.

Here's how it went:

Albanese and Jodie were picked up in a V12 twin-turbo BMW limo, driven to a luxurious Boeing business jet, flown to the game's nearest airport, and met by another BMW on the tarmac. They disembarked, hopped into the BMW, and were driven to the game.

At the venue, they entered a VIP corporate box, ate a seafood platter, drank $500 bottles of wine, took pictures, got driven back to the jet intoxicated, and flew home.

All this, taxpayer-funded, reportedly costing over $120,000 for the day."
