"Something really does not add up here:

US job openings data has been revised downward in 15 of the last 19 months, the longest streak since 2008.

The number of job vacancies has been regularly revised down over the last 18 months, with the largest adjustments reaching over 500,000.

The most recent release for June was lowered by a massive 274,000 openings from the initially reported 8.18 million, the fourth largest revision since 2020.

Meanwhile, job openings for July came at 7.67 million, the lowest since January 2021.

If this number is revised down again, job vacancies would likely be below pre-pandemic levels.

Data revisions are concerning."

"Amazing!  The job market‚Äôs performance is extraordinary.  From today‚Äôs job report: lots of jobs, steadfastly low unemployment, sturdy non-inflationary wage growth, rising participation and boomy labor force growth. Nothing in today‚Äôs report suggests recession.  Just the opposite."
"The job market is steadily but surely throttling back. Monthly job gains are moderating, and most telling, the gains are being consistently revised lower, and not by a little bit. Indeed, after revision, monthly job gains appear to be closing in on 100k. It isn‚Äôt great that the job gains are almost entirely in the healthcare and leisure and hospitality industries. At this pace of job growth, unemployment will continue to push higher, and this, despite weaker labor force participation. None of this signals recession, but it does signal the job market and economy are increasingly fragile as the fallout from the global trade war intensifies."

"The monthly jobs report is a lie.

February: 151K jobs added
‚Ü≥ Revised to 117K
‚Ü≥ Final count? Just 102K

March: 228K

It‚Äôs not just you.

"Don't forget that today's massive downward benchmark revision (2nd largest on record) is on top of the existing downward revision to the initial monthly jobs report figures - btwn all the revisions, job growth for the 12-month period was wildly overestimated almost 1.2 million: https://t.co/bZpKQdTVMA"
"üö®US job downward REVISIONS are massive:

In August, a preliminary revision showed that jobs have been OVERESTIMATED by 818,000 for 12 months ending March 2024.

During today's job report at 8.30 AM ET these revisions will be finally announced by the BLS.

This is a 2nd largest negative revision in history.

Absolutely insane."

Since January 2023, the number of jobs have been revised DOWN by A MASSIVE 471,000, the most since the 2008 Financial Crisis.

"The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to revise job numbers downward by up to 1 million. The job market is in far worse shape than the administration admits. Part-time jobs up, full-time jobs down‚Äîthis is concerning.

"üö®US LABOR MARKET DATA IS ALMOST USELESSüö®

US job openings have been revised DOWN in 16 out of the last 21 months, the most in over 15 years.

The response rate to this survey was just 32.9% in October.

This means 67% of the data is simply guesswork or MADE UP.

The ratio between Americans transitioning from unemployment to employment to the hiring rate fell to the lowest since 2020.

Such a rapid drop has never occurred outside of recessions.

Hiring has rarely been so weak. https://t.co/ekiLIfHfej"

Cerno is spiralling and attacking anons because we‚Äôve been routing him on recent job market debates. Sad to see him resort to these kind of easily disprovable attacks."
