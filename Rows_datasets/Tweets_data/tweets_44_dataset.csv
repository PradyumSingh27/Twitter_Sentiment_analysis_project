And the outcome is here - Indians today are in a Time worse than the British Raj. Was this the 'change' that Modi promised in 2014?

Today - India's Top 1% hold 40% of the country's total wealth.
Bottom 50% holds 6.4% of the Nation's total wealth.
And the top 10% Indians earn 57.7% of the National Income.

This regime not only attacked the words “secular” and “socialist” in the Constitution’s Preamble but torn through its very soul -
Justice,
Liberty,
Equality. 
Fraternity.
