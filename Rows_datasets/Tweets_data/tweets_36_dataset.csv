"India crossed a path from politics of fear and Victimhood to Politics of Anger and Revenge over the last decade.

And the outcome is here - Indians today are in a Time worse than the British Raj. Was this the 'change' that Modi promised in 2014?

Today - India's Top 1% hold 40% of the country's total wealth.
Bottom 50% holds 6.4% of the Nation's total wealth.
And the top 10% Indians earn 57.7% of the National Income.

This regime not only attacked the words “secular” and “socialist” in the Constitution’s Preamble but torn through its very soul -
Justice,
Liberty,
Equality. 
Fraternity. 

How could we missed to see the contempt towards this Constitution they succeeded from their predecessors?

"Rank 2 in NEET PG — yet denied MD Dermatology in India’s top medical colleges.
Why? Because Open Category seats were cut to ZERO under the new reservation policy.

This isn’t justice — it’s the murder of merit.
Hard work is ignored.
Talent is punished.
Politics wins, excellence loses.

A system deeply unfair to those who strive the hardest."
"India crossed a path from politics of fear and Victimhood to Politics of Anger and Revenge over the last decade.

And the outcome is here - Indians today are in a Time worse than the British Raj. Was this the 'change' that Modi promised in 2014?

Today - India's Top 1% hold 40% of the country's total wealth.
Bottom 50% holds 6.4% of the Nation's total wealth.
And the top 10% Indians earn 57.7% of the National Income.

This regime not only attacked the words “secular” and “socialist” in the Constitution’s Preamble but torn through its very soul -
Justice,
Liberty,
Equality. 
Fraternity. 

How could we missed to see the contempt towards this Constitution they succeeded from their predecessors?

Such politics tarnish the image of our nation and its rich legacy of tolerance and decency. Targeting and abusing any particular community is deeply unfortunate. Circulation of such videos not only fuels division at home but also harms India's reputation on the global stage. https://t.co/YxNc7eHY4g

"Politicians today are so out of touch with Reality!

Their ideas are outdated. They are arrogant.

They don't care how you pay rent, school fee or medical bills.

They see your caste- not your struggles.
To them, you're a vote- not a human.

It’s time to REWRITE Indian Politics!"
