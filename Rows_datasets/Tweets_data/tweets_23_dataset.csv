**A Nation That Uses Education as a Tool Is Doomed to Perish**
【把教育当工具的民族，注定灭亡】

🔶The CCP has turned education into a tool and humiliated intellectuals—this is the root cause of China’s national tragedy. By suppressing the education and arts sectors and degrading intellectuals as “stinking old ninths,” the regime has systematically dismantled respect for knowledge. The image of Xi Jinping lecturing a group of university presidents and professors is a true national disgrace. In genuinely civilized nations, teachers are honored, education is valued, and belief is respected. In contrast, China has turned education into a means of brainwashing and control—even a cover for sexual abuse by high-ranking officials, as seen in the RYB Kindergarten scandal. The moral decay of the CCP’s entire system begs the question: can such a nation still be saved?     

🔶中共将教育工具化、羞辱知识分子，是导致中国民族灾难的根源。中共打压教育界、艺术界，把知识分子贬为“臭老九”，习近平对一群校长教授训话的羞辱画面，真是国家悲剧! 真正的文明国家是尊师重教、尊重信仰，把教育者置于至高地位。而中国却把教育变成洗脑与压制的工具，甚至沦为高官性犯罪的遮羞布，如红黄蓝幼儿园，中共整个体系的堕落，这样的民族，还有救吗？

**A Nation That Uses Education as a Tool Is Doomed to Perish**
【把教育当工具的民族，注定灭亡】

🔶The CCP has turned education into a tool and humiliated intellectuals—this is the root cause of China’s national tragedy. By suppressing the education and arts sectors and degrading intellectuals as “stinking old ninths,” the regime has systematically dismantled respect for knowledge. The image of Xi Jinping lecturing a group of university presidents and professors is a true national disgrace. In genuinely civilized nations, teachers are honored, education is valued, and belief is respected. In contrast, China has turned education into a means of brainwashing and control—even a cover for sexual abuse by high-ranking officials, as seen in the RYB Kindergarten scandal. The moral decay of the CCP’s entire system begs the question: can such a nation still be saved?     

🔶中共将教育工具化、羞辱知识分子，是导致中国民族灾难的根源。中共打压教育界、艺术界，把知识分子贬为“臭老九”，习近平对一群校长教授训话的羞辱画面，真是国家悲剧! 真正的文明国家是尊师重教、尊重信仰，把教育者置于至高地位。而中国却把教育变成洗脑与压制的工具，甚至沦为高官性犯罪的遮羞布，如红黄蓝幼儿园，中共整个体系的堕落，这样的民族，还有救吗？

**A Nation That Uses Education as a Tool Is Doomed to Perish**
【把教育当工具的民族，注定灭亡】

🔶The CCP has turned education into a tool and humiliated intellectuals—this is the root cause of China’s national tragedy. By suppressing the education and arts sectors and degrading intellectuals as “stinking old ninths,” the regime has systematically dismantled respect for knowledge. The image of Xi Jinping lecturing a group of university presidents and professors is a true national disgrace. In genuinely civilized nations, teachers are honored, education is valued, and belief is respected. In contrast, China has turned education into a means of brainwashing and control—even a cover for sexual abuse by high-ranking officials, as seen in the RYB Kindergarten scandal. The moral decay of the CCP’s entire system begs the question: can such a nation still be saved?     

🔶中共将教育工具化、羞辱知识分子，是导致中国民族灾难的根源。中共打压教育界、艺术界，把知识分子贬为“臭老九”，习近平对一群校长教授训话的羞辱画面，真是国家悲剧! 真正的文明国家是尊师重教、尊重信仰，把教育者置于至高地位。而中国却把教育变成洗脑与压制的工具，甚至沦为高官性犯罪的遮羞布，如红黄蓝幼儿园，中共整个体系的堕落，这样的民族，还有救吗？
