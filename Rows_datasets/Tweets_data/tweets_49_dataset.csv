"In the wildest imagination of most Indians - a comprehensive electoral loss of #BJP in #Ayodhya was unthinkable.

But that's exactly what happened.

Ayodhya is one of the 5 Assembly Constituencies that form the Faizabad Parliamentary Constituency. These are Dariyabad, Rudauli, Milkipur and Bikapur. Except for the reserved (SC) Constituency of Milkipur (Samajwadi Party), the sitting MLAs in every single of these constituencies are from #BJP.

The incumbent MP Shri Lallu Singh ji was from #BJP (both 2014 and 2019. 

In the 2024 Loksabha elections, Shri #AwadeshPrasad of Samajwadi Party defeated BJP's  #LalluSingh by winning 5,54,289 votes in a voter turnout of 11,40,661 votes. This was a swing of 22.21% gain for the #INDIA candidate when compared to 2019 elections results.

#BJP lagged behind #INDIA in each of the 5 assembly constituencies 

The reason why this happened is well explained in the @BBCHindi report below.

This is exactly the reason that confirms that the mandate for #LokSabha2024 is AGAINST the policies of #NarendraModi led Government in Centre and equally a vote AGAINST #YogiAdityanath's administration in UP.

Their bulldozers in political philosophy are read as fascism. 

With NO respect for the people's rights as assured in the #ConstitutionOfIndia, the manner of their conduct by which they bulldoze their political agenda at the expense of the freedom and rights of common people has been powerfully pushed back by the electorate.

Ayodhya results are proof that dissent-resentment against #BJP and their rejection by the people of India has overcome the religious polarisation that this party does. People from every community -largely #Hindu community have REJECTED the flawed idea of Hindu fascism.

They are now able to see clearly that this is a fascism of individuals and their crony capitalist friends. This has NOTHING to do with Nationalism Or Hinduism Or Patriotism. The party is plainly into plundering and looting. Their leaders are feudal and anti-masses."

"🚨 🆘
What Bihar should learn from Maharashtra. 

In the six months period between Lok Sabha and State Assembly Elections 2024, in Maharashtra,

1) 49 lakh new voters got registered;

2) BJP led Mahayuti got 76 lakh more votes in the Assembly Elections than in Lok Sabha;

3) Congress led MVA got 33 lakh less votes in Assembly elections than in Lok Sabha;

4) 🚨 In a single building in Shirdi, 7,000 new voters were added;

5) 🚨 Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) and NCP-SP contested on 80 and 86 seats respectively. The difference in votes between them was 7 lakh. But Shinde faction won 57 Seats and NCP-SP won 10 seats;

6) 🚨 NCP-SP never raised this drastic anomaly issue ‼️

7) Look at the stellar STRIKE RATES of Shinde faction and Ajit Pawar faction. This, despite popular sentiments being against them and they not finding candidates;

Shiv Sena defection case is still pending in SC. 

CJI Chandrachud observed that Eknath Shinde’s appointment was illegal, Governor Koshyari’s conduct was not as per the law, but he couldn’t pass an Order before his term ended. 

So, be it ECI or SC, the opposition Political parties of Bihar should harbour NO HOPE. 

It was Lalu Prasad Yadav ji who halted the RSS-BJP’s violence spewing Rath Yatra in 1990. LALU ji WILL HAVE TO repeat it again in 2025, for the Nation’s 🇮🇳 sake."

"#WATCH | Patna, Bihar: The Bihar Congress will distribute sanitary pad boxes to women in the state. The box has pictures of Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi and party MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

All India Mahila Congress President Alka Lamba says, ""We conducted a survey in Bihar, and shocking figures came out that in today's modern India, women and daughters of Bihar are using cloth during menstruation and are falling prey to serious diseases. Mahila Congress has taken the initiative to give free sanitary vending machines to our mothers, sisters, daughters of Bihar who are using cloth due to unemployment, inflation, poverty and are unable to buy it... We installed machines, gave free training, free machines, free raw material to make 30,000 pads. And today I am happy to say that these pads are being made by the women of Bihar, they are getting work, earning. We are going to distribute free sanitary pad boxes in the next 2 days. There is a picture of Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi on the box, there will be a picture of our MLAs, brothers, fathers who are helping us in distribution. They are helping us with this awareness. We were thinking that the picture should have been of Nitish Kumar and the Prime Minister as well, because the High Court had asked you to install sanitary vending machines but your government failed, did not install vending machines...To divert attention from the issue, to hide their failure, a controversy is being created in the name of Rahul ji..."""

Ayodhya is one of the 5 Assembly Constituencies that form the Faizabad Parliamentary Constituency. These are Dariyabad, Rudauli, Milkipur and Bikapur. Except for the reserved (SC) Constituency of Milkipur (Samajwadi Party), the sitting MLAs in every single of these constituencies are from #BJP.

The incumbent MP Shri Lallu Singh ji was from #BJP (both 2014 and 2019. 

In the 2024 Loksabha elections, Shri #AwadeshPrasad of Samajwadi Party defeated BJP's  #LalluSingh by winning 5,54,289 votes in a voter turnout of 11,40,661 votes. This was a swing of 22.21% gain for the #INDIA candidate when compared to 2019 elections results.

#BJP lagged behind #INDIA in each of the 5 assembly constituencies 

The reason why this happened is well explained in the @BBCHindi report below.

This is exactly the reason that confirms that the mandate for #LokSabha2024 is AGAINST the policies of #NarendraModi led Government in Centre and equally a vote AGAINST #YogiAdityanath's administration in UP.

Their bulldozers in political philosophy are read as fascism. 

With NO respect for the people's rights as assured in the #ConstitutionOfIndia, the manner of their conduct by which they bulldoze their political agenda at the expense of the freedom and rights of common people has been powerfully pushed back by the electorate.

Ayodhya results are proof that dissent-resentment against #BJP and their rejection by the people of India has overcome the religious polarisation that this party does. People from every community -largely #Hindu community have REJECTED the flawed idea of Hindu fascism.

They are now able to see clearly that this is a fascism of individuals and their crony capitalist friends. This has NOTHING to do with Nationalism Or Hinduism Or Patriotism. The party is plainly into plundering and looting. Their leaders are feudal and anti-masses."

"#WATCH | Patna, Bihar: The Bihar Congress will distribute sanitary pad boxes to women in the state. The box has pictures of Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi and party MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

All India Mahila Congress President Alka Lamba says, ""We conducted a survey in Bihar, and shocking figures came out that in today's modern India, women and daughters of Bihar are using cloth during menstruation and are falling prey to serious diseases. Mahila Congress has taken the initiative to give free sanitary vending machines to our mothers, sisters, daughters of Bihar who are using cloth due to unemployment, inflation, poverty and are unable to buy it... We installed machines, gave free training, free machines, free raw material to make 30,000 pads. And today I am happy to say that these pads are being made by the women of Bihar, they are getting work, earning. We are going to distribute free sanitary pad boxes in the next 2 days. There is a picture of Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi on the box, there will be a picture of our MLAs, brothers, fathers who are helping us in distribution. They are helping us with this awareness. We were thinking that the picture should have been of Nitish Kumar and the Prime Minister as well, because the High Court had asked you to install sanitary vending machines but your government failed, did not install vending machines...To divert attention from the issue, to hide their failure, a controversy is being created in the name of Rahul ji..."""

But in reality, her own political career was ended by an unknown man, Kishori Lal Sharma.

Rahul Gandhi is still active in politics,he is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, while Smriti Irani is back to doing daily soaps.

She was not even chosen for Rajya sabha MP candidate by BJP.

"The 2024 Lok Sabha results from Bengal made it clear that @BJP4India was rapidly losing ground in Cooch Behar. Now that the district has slipped from their iron-fisted grasp, they've returned to what they do best: unleashing BRUTE, MINDLESS VIOLENCE.

When you can't win people’s trust, can’t secure a mandate, can’t fight a clean election, you shoot your way through. This is the true face of the BANGLA JALAO PARTY!"
