"How generative AI could help make construction sites safer | Andrew Rosenblum, MIT Technology Review

The technology could save lives‚Äîso long as it doesn‚Äôt replace humans entirely.

Last winter, during the construction of an affordable housing project on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, Massachusetts, a 32-year-old worker named Jose Luis Collaguazo Crespo slipped off a ladder on the second floor and plunged to his death in the basement. He was one of more than¬†1,000¬†construction¬†workers who die on the job each year in the US, making it the most dangerous industry for fatal slips, trips, and falls.

‚ÄúEveryone talks about [how] ‚Äòsafety is the number-one priority,‚Äô‚Äù entrepreneur and executive Philip Lorenzo said during a presentation at Construction Innovation Day 2025, a conference at the University of California, Berkeley, in April.¬†‚ÄúBut then maybe internally, it‚Äôs not that high priority. People take shortcuts on job sites. And so there‚Äôs this whole tug-of-war between ‚Ä¶ safety and productivity.‚Äù

To combat the shortcuts and risk-taking, Lorenzo is working on a tool for the San Francisco‚Äìbased company DroneDeploy, which sells software that creates daily digital models of¬†work progress from videos and images, known in the trade as ‚Äúreality capture.‚Äù¬† The tool, called Safety AI, analyzes each day‚Äôs reality capture imagery and flags conditions that violate Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, with what he claims is 95% accuracy.

That means that for any safety risk the software flags, there is 95% certainty that the flag is accurate and relates to a specific OSHA regulation. Launched in October 2024, it‚Äôs now being deployed on hundreds of construction sites in the US, Lorenzo says, and versions specific to the building regulations in countries including Canada, the UK, South Korea, and Australia have also been deployed.

Safety AI is one of multiple AI¬†construction¬†safety tools that have emerged in recent years, from¬†Silicon Valley¬†to¬†Hong Kong to¬†Jerusalem. Many of these rely on teams of human ‚Äúclickers,‚Äù often in low-wage countries, to manually draw bounding boxes around images of key objects like ladders, in order to label large volumes of data to train an algorithm.

Lorenzo says Safety AI is the first one to use generative AI to flag safety violations, which means an algorithm that can do more than recognize objects such as ladders or hard hats. The software can ‚Äúreason‚Äù about what is going on in an image of a site and draw a conclusion about whether there is an OSHA violation. This is a more advanced form of analysis than the object detection that is the current industry standard, Lorenzo claims. But as the 95% success rate suggests, Safety AI is not a flawless and all-knowing intelligence. It requires an experienced safety inspector as an overseer.

A visual language model in the real world

Robots and AI tend to thrive in controlled, largely static environments, like factory floors or shipping terminals.¬†But construction¬†sites are, by definition, changing a little bit every day.

Lorenzo thinks he‚Äôs built a better way to monitor sites, using a type of generative AI called a visual language model, or VLM. A VLM is an LLM with a vision encoder, allowing it to ‚Äúsee‚Äù images of the world and analyze what is going on in the scene.

Using years of reality capture imagery gathered from customers, with their explicit permission, Lorenzo‚Äôs team has assembled what he calls a ‚Äúgolden data set‚Äù encompassing tens of thousands of images of OSHA violations. Having carefully stockpiled this specific data for years, he is not worried that even a billion-dollar tech giant will be able to ‚Äúcopy and crush‚Äù him.

To help train the model, Lorenzo has a smaller team of construction safety pros ask strategic questions of the AI. The trainers input test scenes from the golden data set to the VLM and ask questions that guide the model through the process of breaking down the scene and analyzing it step by step the way an experienced human would. If the VLM doesn‚Äôt generate the correct response‚Äîfor example, it misses a violation or registers a false positive‚Äîthe human trainers go back and tweak the prompts or inputs. Lorenzo says that rather than simply learning to recognize objects, the VLM is taught ‚Äúhow to think in a certain way,‚Äù which means it can draw subtle conclusions about what is happening in an image.

As an example, Lorenzo says VLMs are much better than older methods at analyzing ladder usage, which is responsible for 24% of the fall deaths in the construction industry.

‚ÄúWith traditional machine learning, it‚Äôs very difficult to answer the question of ‚ÄòIs a person using a ladder unsafely?‚Äô‚Äù says Lorenzo. ‚ÄúYou can find the ladders. You can find the people. But to logically reason and say ‚ÄòWell, that person is fine‚Äô or ‚ÄòOh no, that person‚Äôs standing on the top step‚Äô‚Äîonly the VLM can logically reason and then be like, ‚ÄòAll right, it‚Äôs unsafe. And here‚Äôs the OSHA reference that says you can‚Äôt be on the top rung.‚Äô‚Äù

Answers to multiple questions (Does the person on the ladder have three points of contact? Are they using the ladder as stilts to move around?) are combined to determine whether the ladder in the picture is being used safely. ‚ÄúOur system has over a dozen layers of questioning just to get to that answer,‚Äù Lorenzo says. DroneDeploy has not publicly released its data for review, but he says he hopes to have his methodology independently audited by safety experts.

The missing 5%

Using vision language models for construction AI shows promise, but there are ‚Äúsome pretty fundamental issues‚Äù to resolve, including hallucinations and the problem of edge cases, those anomalous hazards for which the VLM hasn‚Äôt trained, says Chen Feng. He leads New York University‚Äôs AI4CE lab, which develops technologies for 3D mapping and scene understanding in construction robotics and other areas. ‚ÄúNinety-five percent is encouraging‚Äîbut how do we fix that remaining 5%?‚Äù he asks of Safety AI‚Äôs success rate.

Feng points to a 2024 paper called ‚ÄúEyes Wide Shut?‚Äù‚Äîwritten by Shengbang Tong, a PhD student at NYU, and coauthored by AI luminary Yann LeCun‚Äîthat noted ‚Äúsystematic shortcomings‚Äù in VLMs.¬† ‚ÄúFor object detection, they can reach human-level performance pretty well,‚Äù Feng says. ‚ÄúHowever, for more complicated things‚Äîthese capabilities are still to be improved.‚Äù He notes that VLMs have struggled to interpret 3D scene structure from 2D images, don‚Äôt have good situational awareness in reasoning about spatial relationships, and often lack ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù about visual scenes.

Lorenzo concedes that there are ‚Äúsome major flaws‚Äù with LLMs and that they struggle with spatial reasoning. So Safety AI also employs some older machine-learning methods to help create spatial models of construction sites. These methods include the segmentation of images into crucial components and photogrammetry, an established technique for creating a 3D digital model from a 2D image. Safety AI has also trained heavily in 10 different problem areas, including ladder usage, to anticipate the most common violations.

Even so, Lorenzo admits there are edge cases that the LLM will fail to recognize. But he notes that for overworked safety managers, who are often responsible for as many as 15 sites at once, having an extra set of digital ‚Äúeyes‚Äù is still an improvement.

Aaron Tan, a concrete project manager based in the San Francisco Bay Area, says that a tool like Safety AI could be helpful for these overextended safety managers, who will save a lot of time if they can get an emailed alert rather than having to make a two-hour drive to visit a site in person. And if the software can demonstrate that it is helping keep people safe, he thinks workers will eventually embrace it.

However, Tan notes that workers also fear that these types of tools will be ‚Äúbossware‚Äù used to get them in trouble. ‚ÄúAt my last company, we implemented cameras [as] a security system. And the guys didn‚Äôt like that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey were like, ‚ÄòOh, Big Brother. You guys are always watching me‚ÄîI have no privacy.‚Äô‚Äù

Older doesn‚Äôt mean obsolete

Izhak Paz, CEO of a Jerusalem-based company called Safeguard AI, has considered incorporating VLMs, but he has stuck with the older machine-learning paradigm because he considers it more reliable. The ‚Äúold computer vision‚Äù based on machine learning ‚Äúis still better, because it‚Äôs hybrid between the machine itself and human intervention on dealing with deviation,‚Äù he says. To train the algorithm on a new category of danger, his team aggregates a large volume of labeled footage related to the specific hazard and then optimizes the algorithm by trimming false positives and false negatives. The process can take anywhere from weeks to over six months, Paz says.

With training completed, Safeguard AI performs a risk assessment to identify potential hazards on the site. It can ‚Äúsee‚Äù the site in real time by accessing footage from any nearby internet-connected camera. Then it uses an AI agent to push instructions on what to do next to the site managers‚Äô mobile devices. Paz declines to give a precise price tag, but he says his product is affordable only for builders at the ‚Äúmid-market‚Äù level and above, specifically those managing multiple sites. The tool is in use at roughly 3,500 sites in Israel, the United States, and Brazil.

Buildots, a company based in Tel Aviv that MIT Technology Review profiled back in 2020, doesn‚Äôt do safety analysis but instead creates once- or twice-weekly visual progress reports of sites. Buildots also uses the older method of machine learning with labeled training data. ‚ÄúOur system needs to be 99%‚Äîwe cannot have any hallucinations,‚Äù says CEO Roy Danon.

He says that gaining labeled training data is actually much easier than it was when he and his cofounders began the project in 2018, since gathering video footage of sites means that each object, such as a socket, might be captured and then labeled in many different frames. But the tool is high-end‚Äîabout 50 builders, most with revenue over $250 million, are using Buildots in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Canada, and the US. It‚Äôs been used on over 300 projects so far.

"This battery recycling company is now cleaning up AI data centers | James Temple, MIT Technology Review

Redwood Materials plans to repurpose EV batteries to build renewable-powered microgrids.

In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.

Redwood Materials, one of the US‚Äôs largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.

The event marked the launch of the company‚Äôs new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.

Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.

‚ÄúWe can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,‚Äù JB Straubel, Redwood‚Äôs founder and chief executive, said at the event.

This first microgrid, housed at the company‚Äôs facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation‚Äôs largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.

(That‚Äôs tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to Forbes.)

Redwood‚Äôs project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn‚Äôt be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers.¬†

Since Redwood‚Äôs batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.

Redwood Energy‚Äôs microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they‚Äôre an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.

‚ÄúStorage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,‚Äù Straubel says.

The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as MIT Technology Review recently reported.

Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it ‚Äúwould be logical targets‚Äù for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia, and the Midwest as well.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking to a broad cross section of those companies,‚Äù he says.

Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide ‚Äúpowered data center real estate solutions‚Äù to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.

Redwood‚Äôs microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe‚Äôs local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.

Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)

Redwood‚Äôs new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.

The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.

If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.

‚ÄúHaving a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,‚Äù says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood‚Äôs new microgrid will establish that ‚Äúthese sorts of systems work in the real world‚Äù and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions.

Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.

The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they‚Äôll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company‚Äôs recycling process.

Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour‚Äôs worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company‚Äôs new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.
