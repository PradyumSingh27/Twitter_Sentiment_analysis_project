"Why do Republicans bend over backward to help the rich and not the poor?  Easy answer.

1) because they themselves are rich and stand to benefit

2) because the rich finance their campaigns thus perpetuate the cycle of corruption

3) because it's easier to take from the poor (and claim they're saving money) which is then handed to the rich

4) because the poor don't finance their campaigns and can't fight back like rich people can"

"‚ö†Ô∏èüí•Don't Worry About Tomorrow Frensüí•‚ö†Ô∏è

One of the EASIEST things is to WORRY. 

We Worry about our relationships, our finances, our basic needs, and our future.

In fact, Worry is often our natural first response in MANY situations. 

WHEN WE WORRY, WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER‚ÄºÔ∏è

If we COULD control it, then we WOULDN‚ÄôT be Worrying about it. 

But Jesus says that we SHOULDN‚ÄôT spend our time Worrying about basic things, because GOD KNOWS WHAT WE NEED and will provide those things for us - Matthew 6:25-26 ‚úùÔ∏è

God takes care of the birds, the flowers, and the rest of creation, but JESUS SAYS THAT OUR LIVES MATTER MORE TO GOD THAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

If God takes care of His other creations, then WE CAN TRUST THAT HE WILL ALSO TAKE CARE OF US.

 Worrying about the future can‚Äôt make it any better‚Äîit just makes today worse. 

The Fear of the Unknown can sometimes Paralyze us in the Present.

But instead of Worrying about the future, Jesus tells us to TRUST GOD.

God is the only one who can control what‚Äôs to come.

Since He is all-knowing and all-powerful, HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS POWER OVER THE FUTURE.

So instead of anxiously ruminating on ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù we should TRUST GOD.

We should make the most of each day that we have, and let tomorrow take care of itself.

Like Jesus says: each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow is unknown‚Äîso don‚Äôt fixate on what might happen tomorrow.

If you struggle with Worrying:

Ask God To Give You Peace ‚úåÔ∏è 

Begin to shift your perspective from Worrying About Tomorrow toward focusing on what God Has Put In Front Of You Today.

Your Worries will lessen when Your Trust In God Grows.

And Your Trust in God Will Grow as your Worries lessen.

So remind yourself of how much God Cares For You.

HE WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU‚ÄºÔ∏è

üôèPrayer For The Dayüôè

The courage to try to control or change only those things I can 

 And the wisdom to know the difference 

In Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen üôèüôèüôè

"‚ö†Ô∏èüí•Don't Worry About Tomorrow Frensüí•‚ö†Ô∏è

One of the EASIEST things is to WORRY. 

We Worry about our relationships, our finances, our basic needs, and our future.

In fact, Worry is often our natural first response in MANY situations. 

WHEN WE WORRY, WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER‚ÄºÔ∏è

If we COULD control it, then we WOULDN‚ÄôT be Worrying about it. 

But Jesus says that we SHOULDN‚ÄôT spend our time Worrying about basic things, because GOD KNOWS WHAT WE NEED and will provide those things for us - Matthew 6:25-26 ‚úùÔ∏è

God takes care of the birds, the flowers, and the rest of creation, but JESUS SAYS THAT OUR LIVES MATTER MORE TO GOD THAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

If God takes care of His other creations, then WE CAN TRUST THAT HE WILL ALSO TAKE CARE OF US.

 Worrying about the future can‚Äôt make it any better‚Äîit just makes today worse. 

The Fear of the Unknown can sometimes Paralyze us in the Present.

But instead of Worrying about the future, Jesus tells us to TRUST GOD.

God is the only one who can control what‚Äôs to come.

Since He is all-knowing and all-powerful, HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS POWER OVER THE FUTURE.

So instead of anxiously ruminating on ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù we should TRUST GOD.

We should make the most of each day that we have, and let tomorrow take care of itself.

Like Jesus says: each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow is unknown‚Äîso don‚Äôt fixate on what might happen tomorrow.

If you struggle with Worrying:

Ask God To Give You Peace ‚úåÔ∏è 

Begin to shift your perspective from Worrying About Tomorrow toward focusing on what God Has Put In Front Of You Today.

Your Worries will lessen when Your Trust In God Grows.

And Your Trust in God Will Grow as your Worries lessen.

So remind yourself of how much God Cares For You.

HE WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU‚ÄºÔ∏è

He will continue to take care of you and direct your paths.

Banks are pouring money into ecocidal global forest destruction.

Between January 2023 and June 2024 banks gave $77 BILLION in credit to deforestation projects, according to the Forest &amp; Finance Coalition of research.

One of the EASIEST things is to WORRY. 

We Worry about our relationships, our finances, our basic needs, and our future.

In fact, Worry is often our natural first response in MANY situations. 

WHEN WE WORRY, WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER‚ÄºÔ∏è

If we COULD control it, then we WOULDN‚ÄôT be Worrying about it. 

But Jesus says that we SHOULDN‚ÄôT spend our time Worrying about basic things, because GOD KNOWS WHAT WE NEED and will provide those things for us - Matthew 6:25-26 ‚úùÔ∏è

God takes care of the birds, the flowers, and the rest of creation, but JESUS SAYS THAT OUR LIVES MATTER MORE TO GOD THAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

If God takes care of His other creations, then WE CAN TRUST THAT HE WILL ALSO TAKE CARE OF US.

 Worrying about the future can‚Äôt make it any better‚Äîit just makes today worse. 

The Fear of the Unknown can sometimes Paralyze us in the Present.

But instead of Worrying about the future, Jesus tells us to TRUST GOD.

God is the only one who can control what‚Äôs to come.

Since He is all-knowing and all-powerful, HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS POWER OVER THE FUTURE.

So instead of anxiously ruminating on ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù we should TRUST GOD.

We should make the most of each day that we have, and let tomorrow take care of itself.

Like Jesus says: each day has enough trouble of its own, and tomorrow is unknown‚Äîso don‚Äôt fixate on what might happen tomorrow.

If you struggle with Worrying:

Ask God To Give You Peace ‚úåÔ∏è 

Begin to shift your perspective from Worrying About Tomorrow toward focusing on what God Has Put In Front Of You Today.

Your Worries will lessen when Your Trust In God Grows.

And Your Trust in God Will Grow as your Worries lessen.

So remind yourself of how much God Cares For You.

HE WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU‚ÄºÔ∏è

He will continue to take care of you and direct your paths.

üôèPrayer For The Dayüôè

Heavenly Father grant me the serenity to accept the things today I cannot change or control 

The courage to try to control or change only those things I can 

 And the wisdom to know the difference 

In Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen üôèüôèüôè
