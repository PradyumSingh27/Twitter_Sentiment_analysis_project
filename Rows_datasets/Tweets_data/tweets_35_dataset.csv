"Democrats pretended to support justice and oppose racism, then Biden exposed them all as frauds in Gaza. Republicans pretended to support free speech and oppose war, then Trump exposed them as frauds with his Israel policy. US politics is just empty noise draped over an empire.

That's all it is. The pundits and politicians could all be speaking in baby talk gibberish and it wouldn't matter. Presidential candidates could have their debates speaking Esperanto and it wouldn't change anything. The only reason they bother using coherent English words at all is so people don't get suspicious and start noticing that the politics of the United States are just empty noises fed to the public to let them feel like they've got some control while the tank treads of the empire roll onward.

It's like this in all western ""democracies"". The public is split into two equal factions who are then pitted against each other on issues that are guaranteed not to inconvenience the powerful in any way, and then the state just does what's in the interests of the empire without regard for any of the noises being made in the political sphere. And the brainwashed masses just keep babbling on about their politics, completely unaffected by the fact that the things their government is doing run squarely counter to the values they purport to hold. There's no real connection between the two."

"My main frustration with American politics right now is that so much political chatter is devoted to chastizing Democrats as out of touch or elitist, but Republican leaders say stuff like this all the time and don't face many consequences."
"I think America basically has 8 political factions right now, 4 Democratic and 4 Republican. Nearly every politician is able to be paced within this system somewhere, tho some maybe more tricky to place than others. Here's a thread explaining each faction:"
"Religious protesters were arrested after occupying the U.S. Capitol Building cafeteria. Their message: ""Congress doesn't eat until Gaza eats."" https://t.co/oTtc7qw9Bw"
"The biggest problem in American politics isn't that the Democrats aren't left wing enough, it's that the US legislative system is broken and makes passing most legislation incredibly difficult and a few people stand in the way of reforming it"
"The central story of American politics right now is that one of the two parties is *radicalizing against democracy* in front of our eyes. There are tons of other stories as well, but they all come after that, I think."
"The main problem with American politics is that Republican voters think they’re the silent majority (they’re not) which makes them comfortable with embracing radicalism while Democrats, despite progressive policies being overwhelmingly popular, are constantly on the defense."
"Today in American politics:

• A U.S. senator says democracy isn't very important.
• A member of Congress says citizens of a large metropolis aren't really ""American.""
• We learn a ""militia"" group wanted to kidnap a state governor."
"US is just a fever dream of politics. Basically no political education, it’s full of grifters snd there are only two relevant parties"
"US politics is increasingly Red MAGA and Blue MAGA playing ‘Who’s the Bigger Fascist?’ and, while this is objectively horrific, only the most propagandised can still believe that this Pantomime of Death can actually provide any solutions to the overlapping crises it has created."

"The main problem with American politics is that Republican voters think they’re the silent majority (they’re not) which makes them comfortable with embracing radicalism while Democrats, despite progressive policies being overwhelmingly popular, are constantly on the defense."
"The central story of American politics right now is that one of the two parties is *radicalizing against democracy* in front of our eyes. There are tons of other stories as well, but they all come after that, I think."

"US politics is increasingly Red MAGA and Blue MAGA playing ‘Who’s the Bigger Fascist?’ and, while this is objectively horrific, only the most propagandised can still believe that this Pantomime of Death can actually provide any solutions to the overlapping crises it has created."
"Today in American politics:

• A U.S. senator says democracy isn't very important.
• A member of Congress says citizens of a large metropolis aren't really ""American.""
• We learn a ""militia"" group wanted to kidnap a state governor."

"US is just a fever dream of politics. Basically no political education, it’s full of grifters snd there are only two relevant parties"
"American politics is pure nihilism. Neither party nor their base is interested in building anything anymore. No vision for the future, just an endless Inferno where each side jockeys to inflict damage every election cycle"
The biggest problems in American politics right now are that democrats think that progressive policy is something they need to hide and that republicans think that the country is center-right. Both perceptions are totally wrong. It can't even be debated.
"Micro-politics dictate macro policy. “Gender wars” “diaspora wars” “class wars” all these discussions are priming you to not see women’s rights, immigrant/poc rights, and overall equity as important. But those civil rights and liberties are actually relevant to all lives in usa"
"Democrats pretended to support justice and oppose racism, then Biden exposed them all as frauds in Gaza. Republicans pretended to support free speech and oppose war, then Trump exposed them as frauds with his Israel policy. US politics is just empty noise draped over an empire.

That's all it is. The pundits and politicians could all be speaking in baby talk gibberish and it wouldn't matter. Presidential candidates could have their debates speaking Esperanto and it wouldn't change anything. The only reason they bother using coherent English words at all is so people don't get suspicious and start noticing that the politics of the United States are just empty noises fed to the public to let them feel like they've got some control while the tank treads of the empire roll onward.

It's like this in all western ""democracies"". The public is split into two equal factions who are then pitted against each other on issues that are guaranteed not to inconvenience the powerful in any way, and then the state just does what's in the interests of the empire without regard for any of the noises being made in the political sphere. And the brainwashed masses just keep babbling on about their politics, completely unaffected by the fact that the things their government is doing run squarely counter to the values they purport to hold. There's no real connection between the two."

"My main frustration with American politics right now is that so much political chatter is devoted to chastizing Democrats as out of touch or elitist, but Republican leaders say stuff like this all the time and don't face many consequences."
A brief overview of what's happening in American politics: https://t.co/UxeeNWsdvm
"The central story of American politics right now is that one of the two parties is *radicalizing against democracy* in front of our eyes. There are tons of other stories as well, but they all come after that, I think."
"Today in American politics:

• A U.S. senator says democracy isn't very important.
• A member of Congress says citizens of a large metropolis aren't really ""American.""
• We learn a ""militia"" group wanted to kidnap a state governor."
"The main problem with American politics is that Republican voters think they’re the silent majority (they’re not) which makes them comfortable with embracing radicalism while Democrats, despite progressive policies being overwhelmingly popular, are constantly on the defense."
"I think America basically has 8 political factions right now, 4 Democratic and 4 Republican. Nearly every politician is able to be paced within this system somewhere, tho some maybe more tricky to place than others. Here's a thread explaining each faction:"
"The U.S. is split between Democrats and Republicans, but Republicans now control almost all levels of government https://t.co/GGZ2PDFHkP"
"The biggest problem in American politics isn't that the Democrats aren't left wing enough, it's that the US legislative system is broken and makes passing most legislation incredibly difficult and a few people stand in the way of reforming it"
"US politics is just all out warfare now... Senate blocking Merrick Garland hearings 5 yrs ago and pushing through a nominee 1 month before election confirms it. Only norm is realpolitik.

It is what it is I guess."
"basically looking like total republican control of the entire federal government, both houses of Congress plus the presidency and Supreme Court"
"The republicans are holding Nazi rallies and the democrats are funding a genocide so America is super fucked up already, in case you thought it might magically change next week."
"Religious protesters were arrested after occupying the U.S. Capitol Building cafeteria. Their message: ""Congress doesn't eat until Gaza eats."" https://t.co/oTtc7qw9Bw"
The biggest problems in American politics right now are that democrats think that progressive policy is something they need to hide and that republicans think that the country is center-right. Both perceptions are totally wrong. It can't even be debated.
"US politics is increasingly Red MAGA and Blue MAGA playing ‘Who’s the Bigger Fascist?’ and, while this is objectively horrific, only the most propagandised can still believe that this Pantomime of Death can actually provide any solutions to the overlapping crises it has created."
"Trump-era cuts gutted a national legal aid program that helped immigrants in court, including those with mental illness. Now, many face deportation alone. https://t.co/8eaSXaQEU4"
