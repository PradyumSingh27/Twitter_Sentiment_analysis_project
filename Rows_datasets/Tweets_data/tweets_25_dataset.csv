"happiest book ever, happy characters, everyone’s happy, totally wholesome book‼️‼️❣️❣️

— the poppy war series by R.F. Kuang

★★★★☆ (4,5)

— very quick review below https://t.co/uF0PGkryai"
Well here is my review of Sarah's book on Barnes and Noble. It is presently being reviewed by a mod.  I guess we will see what happens. https://t.co/oCVwugbwBS
"Many Americans are extremely angry. Countless voters cast their ballots expecting the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s files, including the infamous Black Book. Yet, despite claims of abundant evidence under review, the public has been met with nothing but silence from the White House.
 
How can Americans trust assurances of transparency when no action follows? The lack of disclosure breeds doubt and frustration. 
 
Two key points: One, God and Jesus are always watching over us, keenly observing our choices and actions. He presents us with a profound challenge: Who among us will expose the truth? Will we choose to remain passive and silent, or will we rise to the occasion and unveil the truth?  

Ephesians 5:11-14 ""Do not engage in the unfruitful works of darkness; instead, expose them."" 

This powerful verse encourages us to shine a light on the darkness that often lurks beneath the surface, urging us to confront and reveal the truth. 

Trust is a very difficult thing to regain once it is lost.

First thing-- that's a fantastic review.  Short, simple-- don't have to say a lot, but tell other readers your impression.

Second thing-- buy the book, or I swear to all that is holy, I will start chucking Commies out of the helo.  Don't test me."

Don’t take my word for it. Here a good book review. https://t.co/iktACk00BW
"Final review… 1000/10. In its pages I found myself, everyone I’ve ever loved, and everyone I’ve ever hated. 

East of Eden by John Steinbeck is a quintessential Great American Novel and officially my favorite book (until I find something I love more). https://t.co/e7fgAzxcci"

I've fallen in love with these covers, and I'm struggling to think of a reason not to grab at least the first book.

"📔 Rifka’s Review: “Butter” - Asako Yuzuki (4/5⭐️)

Despite the fact that the writing is not really my cup of tea, I quite liked the book. I’d say this book comes with important discussions on patriarchal society, but it lacks any novelty or striking new ideas on the matter. https://t.co/RzU8AMKbAL"
