To me, it’s a proud moment of Philippine Cinema. Wag nyo hanapin yung mala-Marvel kind of effects because millions of dollars budget non. If may negative lang siguro the script, acting and ung volt-in song. But the fight scenes? Served! https://t.co/hYRpWblvKJ"

"My unsolicited movie review for F1:

IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!! My 15yo son and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.  Every minute of the whole 2 1/2 hours was entertaining, engaging, and exciting. There was ZERO woke bullshit - the story line was strictly about racing - no side liberal agendas ruining any of the plot lines. It really was an excellent film - definitely go see it if you can - you’ll love it."

The Lost World is a great fucking movie. I have had enough of these “reviews” - go see a movie and enjoy it or hate it on your own accord.
"Predator: Killer of Killers: What a sick animated addition to the Predator universe. Three very unique &amp; different stories blended into one big plot. It’s not for everyone but I love this universe &amp; can’t wait for what’s to come. Feed me more.

IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!! My 15yo son and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.  Every minute of the whole 2 1/2 hours was entertaining, engaging, and exciting. There was ZERO woke bullshit - the story line was strictly about racing - no side liberal agendas ruining any of the plot lines. It really was an excellent film - definitely go see it if you can - you’ll love it."
"When I reviewed The Creator, I said it was one of those movies that gets stupider the more you think about it.

The same guy directed Jurassic World Rebirth, and it has the same problem."

To me, it’s a proud moment of Philippine Cinema. Wag nyo hanapin yung mala-Marvel kind of effects because millions of dollars budget non. If may negative lang siguro the script, acting and ung volt-in song. But the fight scenes? Served! https://t.co/hYRpWblvKJ"

"A late review from my POV

RETRO

Positives: 
Suriya (mirror scene) and PJ performance🔥
Music and BGM by SaNa💥
Action scenes and DOP(especially the 15 mins single-shot) 
Retro song placement
M

Negatives:
Second half wasn't as good as first half but still ain't bad

Worth🔥 https://t.co/8WA6FR5uJa"

"#Nagarjuna about #Coolie:

- #AamirKhan and I don't have scenes together. We have two different chapters in the film😲
- Aamir's performance is brilliant. You'll see a new Aamir and be shocked🥵💥
- Being the main antagonist, I had many scenes with #Rajinikanth sir. It's him against me🤜🤛"
