#SoulMovie is one of the best-animated films I've seen in years. This is a film that shows what animation is capable of and is one of the most mature and thought-provoking animated films from Pixar. It's a masterpeice. See it when you can. I'll give you my review on Tuesday. https://t.co/fc8IybwEF2

"Elio is another wonderful film from Pixar. This film is such a lovely and whimsical tale about what it means to find others to connect with a heartfelt emotional story, gorgeous animation, and fun characters. I really really love this one. I‚Äôll give you my full review very soon. https://t.co/kz6VIaqKkk"

"Sony Pictures Animation has released a new film where a K-pop group fights demons and takes on a demon boy band. It's another stellar film from the studio who shines as one of our best players working today. Anyway, here's my review of KPop Demon Hunters. Link in the post below. https://t.co/Ow5Btw0vh2"
"a lot of modern animation has a clean, cute and soft-on-the-eyes aesthetic, on top of trying to emulate the look of 2D with cel shading and rendering and whatnot, and thats fine for most stuff, but you rarely see mainstream examples of the opposite aesthetic https://t.co/vxHqmxwW7G"
"KPop Demon Hunters is a hilarious and energetic ride from Sony Pictures Animation. It continues to show that they're among the best working today in animation thanks to its hilarious energy, great music, and fantastic themes. Tons of fun! I'll give you my full review very soon. https://t.co/HuoXgK31X3"
One Piece just had one of the best animated sequences I've ever seen.... Its animation team is unfair to other seasonal shows. https://t.co/GQ8BPg0HiT

A great example of varied rhythm: strong contrast in rhythm shows moments of change in the character's action
