"This is a scene from a very popular Bollywood movie. In it, the main and beloved character is cussing out & insulting her white neighbour for no good reason in her language. Racism is SO normal among brown people against whites. In fact, I was often uncomfortable at how easily cousins and family members casually said the most vile stuff about white people at parties. Now that brown people are getting it handed back to them they’re upset. How do you say it? karma is a bitch?"

"Mamdani’s mother is a world-famous, Academy Award-nominated Bollywood director worth tens of millions of dollars. His father is a chaired professor at Columbia.

He is, in effect, a perpetual theatre kid who’s pretending to be “Third World.” It’s all so, so performative + stupid."

"So Osama bin Laden was jamming to Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik while sending thousands to die in the name of ‘jihad’? Just a reminder: it was never about faith. ‘Jihad’ was hijacked as a political weapon—while the men at the top lived in luxury, watched Bollywood, and left others to bleed for their fantasies.

Man  Bollywood has another level impact!"
